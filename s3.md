### S3

Amazon S3 or Amazon Simple Storage Service is a service offered by Amazon Web Services that provides object storage through a web service interface. We will use CLI instead to help with IaC . In S3 files are stored in buckets which are similar to Azures blobs.
#### Configure AWS
```
aws config

access key:

secret key:

region name: eu-west-1

default output format: json
```
#### Install packages
```
pip install awscli #Access AWS
pip install boto3 #Establish connection to S3
```
### AWS CLI
```
aws s3 ls - listing all the buckets (containers)

aws s3 mb s3://tech241-henry-bucket --region eu-west-1 - creating a bucket

aws s3 cp testfile.txt s3://tech241-henry-bucket - upload the file to the bucket

aws s3 sync s3://tech241-henry-bucket s3_download - get the files from the bucket

aws s3 rm s3://tech241-henry-bucket/testfile.txt - delete the file from the bucket

aws s3 rm s3://tech241-henry-bucket --recursive - delete everything from the bucket. all the files inside but not the bucket

aws s3 rb s3://tech241-henry6-bucket - delete the bucket
```
### boto3

#### Create bucket
```
# Import boto3
import boto3

# Set up S3 connection
s3 = boto3.client("s3")

# Create a bucket in the eu-west-1 region
bucket_name = s3.create_bucket(Bucket= "tech241-henry-python-bucket", CreateBucketConfiguration={"LocationConstraint":"eu-west-1"})

# Print bucket name to confirm working script
print(bucket_name)
```
#### Upload to bucket
```
# Import boto3
import boto3

# Set up S3 connection
s3 = boto3.client("s3")

# Upload file to S3
upload_file = s3.upload_file("testfile.txt", "tech241-henry-python-bucket" , "testfile.txt")

# Print successfully uploaded to confirm working script
print("Successfully Uploaded File")
```
#### Download from bucket
```
# s3.download_file(bucket_name, object_name, file_path)
# Download File
# Import boto3
import boto3

# Set up S3 connection
s3 = boto3.client("s3")

# Download file from S3
s3.download_file("tech241-henry-python-bucket", "testfile.txt", "testdownload.txt")

# Print successfully uploaded to confirm working script
print("Successfully Downloaded File")
```
#### Delete bucket
```
import boto3

s3 = boto3.resource("s3")

bucket = s3.Bucket("tech241-henry-python-bucket")

response = bucket.delete()

print(response)
```
